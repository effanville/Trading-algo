# Trading-algo
Basic stock trading algorithm using lasso regression. The code given is for the testing simulation, so cannot be used to trade in real time without modification.

Note: this was written for Ubuntu 16, so code is unlikely to compile on windows

The program has certain requirements, for example the existence of the folder Data/ with various stock data included, see the information in that folder for details

Also requires a folder Outputs

Disclaimer: This is code for testing a mathematical based algorithm. As such many checks that should be present are not, so you must know what is going on before using. It also does not have many comments throughout the code. These will be added in due course.
